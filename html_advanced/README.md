# HTML

- HTML or Hyper Text Markup Language is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displated in a web browser. It is often using with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and scripting languages like JavaScript.

- The goal of this project was to create an outline of a webpage using only HTML. No styling \(CSS) or scripting \(JavaScript).

- HTML elements are dilineated by tags such as \<img> and \<p> for displaying images and text, respectively. The \<blockquote> tag is used for longer quotes from an outside source. The output of a blockquote is indented. \<section> tags are used to seperate content by theme while \<div> tags are used to contain content, making it easy to stylize content.
